# ManiLogix

The consolidated Spring Modulith application is in [Coding/manilogix-modulith](Coding/manilogix-modulith/README.md). It is the implementation for new development. The services in `Coding/*-service` are retained as migration references; do not start them alongside the Modulith against the same data. Historical MySQL and MongoDB data has **not** been imported. Read the [flow review](Coding/manilogix-modulith/FLOW_REVIEW.md) and migration notes before cutover.

# 🏭 ManiLogix – Enterprise Supply Chain Management System

**ManiLogix** is a scalable, microservices-based backend system designed to manage B2B supply chain operations like supplier onboarding, inventory control, order processing, and role-based access via JWT. Built entirely using **Spring Boot Microservices**, it's modular, maintainable, and ready for frontend integration or deployment on cloud-native infrastructure.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **JWT Auth & Role-Based Access**: Secure login and signup flow for Admin, Manager, and Supplier roles.
- ⚙️ **Microservice Architecture**: Each module runs independently and communicates via REST APIs with Eureka service discovery and Gateway routing.
- 📦 **Inventory Control**: Add, update, delete, and track stock.
- 📑 **Supplier Management**: Onboard new suppliers and manage details.
- 📦 **Order Workflow**: Place, update, and manage the lifecycle of product orders.
- 🔔 **Notification System**: Trigger and track user-specific system events (via Notification service).
- 🔍 **Central API Gateway**: All traffic passes through the gateway for unified routing and security.
- 🔁 **Eureka Discovery**: Automatically registers all services, enabling fault-tolerant communication.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

**Backend Stack:**

- **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Security + JWT**
- **Spring Cloud** (Eureka, Gateway, OpenFeign)
- **REST APIs**, **DTOs**, **Lombok**, **MapStruct**
- **MySQL** (or H2 for development)
- **MongoDB**
- **Maven** for dependency management

**Architecture:**

- 📦 Microservices (modular)
- 📡 API Gateway & Eureka
- 💬 REST Communication using Feign
- 🔐 Token validation across services
- 🧩 Shared libraries for DTO reuse

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧾 Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- MySQL (or H2 for dev)
- Postman (optional, for testing)

### 🔧 Run Order

# Start Eureka
cd eureka-server
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start API Gateway
cd api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start Auth Service
cd auth-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start Inventory, Supplier, Order, Notification (one by one)
cd inventory-service
mvn spring-boot:run

All APIs are accessible via Gateway:
http://localhost:8080

🌐 API Summary:

Module	Key Routes
Auth	/auth/signup, /auth/login, /auth/validate
Inventory	/inventory/add, /inventory/all, /inventory/{id}
Supplier	/suppliers/add, /suppliers/all, /suppliers/{id}
Order	/orders/create, /orders/all, /orders/status
Notification	/notifications/send, /notifications/user/{id}

All endpoints secured via Bearer Token.

📊 Suggested Frontend (Not Included):
   You can build a frontend (React, Angular, etc.) with:
   🔐 Login + Signup Pages
   🖥️ Separate Dashboards for:
      Admin (View/Add all entities)
      Manager (Inventory/Order)
      Supplier (View Profile & Orders)

🚀 Future Enhancements:
   Swagger/OpenAPI Docs
   Docker Compose for full environment spin-up
   Kafka Integration (for notifications and event handling)
   Frontend (React or Angular)
   Email/SMS Notifications
   Centralized Config Server

🧪 Example Use Case
✅ A Manager logs in via Auth Service
✅ Views or modifies inventory and order records
✅ Backend validates the token via Auth’s /validate
✅ Supplier receives notifications when assigned new orders
✅ Admin can create users and assign roles during signup
